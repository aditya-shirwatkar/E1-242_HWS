This course is on the description, analysis and control of nonlinear systems. Nonlinear systems occur everywhere - in nature and in numerous engineering applications. So, it is very useful to a controls practitioner or theorist to have a good understanding of nonlinear systems and methods to design controllers for them. The focus of the course leans towards mathematical theory and analysis. However, interesting applications in various domains would also be discussed frequently.

Core topics:
  - Equilibria and qualitative behavior\
  - Existence and uniqueness of solutions
  - Lyapunov stability, invariance principle, converse theorems, ultimate boundedness, input-to-state stability

Selected topics from:

  - Control Lyapunov functions and Control Barrier functions
  - Input-output stability, small-gain theorem, passivity
  - Feedback linearization, gain scheduling, sliding mode control, backstepping
  - Intro to switched and hybrid systems
  - Applications in networked control such as control over channels with quantization, sampling, time delays
  - Applications in distributed systems and control such as consensus, synchronization, coverage, etc.
  - Applications in social systems - population dynamics and opinion dynamics
